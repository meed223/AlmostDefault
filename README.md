# AlmostDefault
A tool for upscaling Minecraft textures, making them "less edgy" in the process. Based off the [NearlyDefault](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/nearlydefault) texture pack, and the algorithm used to create it, by Qwertz19281.

## About
This project has been a learning project for writing rust, so structure / organisation / etc. may not be perfect.  

### Goals / Planned Features:
* [ ] CLI Argument support for pointing to directories, setting the size to upscale to
* [ ] Generate textures similar to the original
* [ ] Modify code to be async / multi-threaded, to process several textures at once (*stretch goal*)

## Acknowledgements
Thanks again to [Qwertz19281](https://github.com/qwertz19281) for making the original pack and coming up with the script.
